Twitter Sentiment Classifier📌

Project OverviewThis:

Project was developed as part of the Python 3 course from Univerisity of Michigan specialization on Coursera. The goal is to build a sentiment classifier that processes synthetic Twitter data to determine the emotional tone of tweets. By comparing words in a tweet against predefined lists of positive and negative terms, the script calculates a "Net Score" and exports the data for further analysis and visualization.


Features:

-Data Cleaning: Custom punctuation removal to ensure accurate word matching
-Sentiment Analysis: Functions to calculate positive and negative word counts based on external dictionaries
-Data Export: Generates a structured resulting_data.csv file containing engagement metrics and sentiment scores
-Correlation Analysis: Prepares data for visualizing the relationship between tweet sentiment and retweet counts.


File Structure:

project_twitter_data.csv: The raw input data containing tweet text, retweet counts, and reply counts.
positive_words.txt: A reference file containing words associated with positive sentiment
negative_words.txt: A reference file containing words associated with negative sentiment
sentiment_classifier.py: The main Python script containing the logic for analysis
resulting_data.csv: The final output file generated by the script.


How it Works

The classifier follows a simple but effective logic:
Cleanse: The strip_punctuation function removes special characters from the text.
Score: * get_pos counts occurrences of positive words.get_neg counts occurrences of negative words
Calculate: The Net Score is derived using the formula:
Net Score = Positive Score - Negative Score

Export: 

The results are saved into a CSV file with the following columns:Number of RetweetsNumber of RepliesPositive ScoreNegative ScoreNet Score📊 Visualizing ResultsAfter generating resulting_data.csv, the data was imported into Excel/Google Sheets to create a scatter plot. This visualization helps identify if there is a correlation between the sentiment of a tweet (Net Score) and its popularity (Number of Retweets).
